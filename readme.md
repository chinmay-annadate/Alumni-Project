# Alumni Project
A script written by me and my team to send emails to Alumni of our college wishing them a happy birthday
- The script is set to execute once a day.
- It fetches data from a Google Sheet linked to a Google Form. From there it searches for students who were born today.
- It sends a html & css embedded email to those students.
